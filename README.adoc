= Spring Boot MQ demo application

Sample application demonstrating the usage of the http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22mq-jms-spring-boot-starter%22[Spring Boot Starter for MQ].

MQ runs in a docker container which can be started via docker-compose (see `/src/test/resource/docker-compose.yml`) or automatically via https://www.testcontainers.org/[Testcontainers] during testing.

To run this project, first start the MQ container:

`docker-compose -f /src/test/resource/docker-compose.yml up`

Then run the application using maven:

`./mvnw spring-boot:run`
