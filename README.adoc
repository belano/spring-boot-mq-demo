= Spring Boot MQ demo application

Sample application demonstrating the usage of the http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22mq-jms-spring-boot-starter%22[Spring Boot Starter for MQ].

.Requirements
* Java 11
* Docker & Compose

== Running the application

MQ runs in a docker container which can be started via docker-compose (see `/src/test/resources/docker/docker-compose.yml`) or automatically via https://www.testcontainers.org/[Testcontainers] during testing.

To run this project, first start the MQ container:

`docker-compose --env-file .env -f /src/test/resources/docker/docker-compose.yml up`

Additionally, a helper script has been added at project root called "run.sh" to assist in setting up the local environment

`./run.sh setup`

For tearing down the MQ container

`./run.sh teardown`

Once the container is up and running, then run the application using maven wrapper:

`./mvnw spring-boot:run`
